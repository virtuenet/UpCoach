Per-Page AutoFlow Prompt Suggestions
--------------------------------------------

1. Main Page (Landing Overview)
/ 
Create a high-converting landing layout that introduces the UpCoach brand. Include a bold hero banner, download buttons, and a visual of the app in action (chat with AI coach). Below, add a brief section previewing the app’s key features with smooth anchor navigation.

2. Features Section
Use a responsive grid to present 3–6 core features of UpCoach with icons, titles, and short blurbs. Prioritize features like AI Coach (chat + voice), Mood Tracker, Task Extraction, Self-Coaching Tools, Learning Library, and Live Coaching Now. Include hover animations and short tooltips like “ℹ️ Why this?”

3. Demo Section
Create a video or carousel section that visually walks users through the experience of using UpCoach. Include short looping clips or YouTube embeds of onboarding, avatar chat, role-play practice, and progress reporting. Provide minimal text captions under each demo.

4. Testimonials Section
Build social proof with user testimonials. Display 2–3 quotes with user avatars or initials. Design for mobile stacking and include a slight fade-in scroll animation. Allow easy CMS update of quotes.

5. How It Works Section
Design a step-by-step layout using cards or horizontal scroll. Each step shows a simple icon, title, and short explanation. Steps include: “Onboard,” “Meet Your Coach,” “Receive Nudges,” “Track Growth.” Make it feel easy, welcoming, and goal-oriented.

6. Pricing Section
Design a comparison table for Free, Pro, and Team plans. Each plan should highlight features, pricing, and a CTA button ("Start Free," "Upgrade in App"). Include subtle animations on hover. This section should link directly to the app store pages.

7. FAQ Section
Implement an accordion-style FAQ section. Questions should focus on privacy, features, data syncing, avatar choices, and offline access. Make it WCAG-compliant, keyboard-navigable, and styled lightly to match the theme.

8. Footer
Include download buttons for App Store & Play Store, links to Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and social icons (LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram). Style the footer with soft background color and consistent paddings. Optionally include a small brand tagline: “Your AI Coach at Work.”
