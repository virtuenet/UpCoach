# UpCoach Platform Implementation Orchestration Plan

## Executive Summary

As Task Orchestrator Lead, I have analyzed the UpCoach platform's current state and identified the critical implementation gaps that must be addressed for production readiness. This orchestration plan coordinates specialist teams across multiple domains to systematically complete the platform implementation.

## Current State Analysis

### Platform Status Overview
- **Deployment State**: Post-deployment with production configuration complete
- **Core Infrastructure**: Docker, environment configurations, and basic services operational
- **Critical Gaps**: Feature-level implementations incomplete across mobile, web, and backend services
- **Last Commit**: "Complete Production Deployment: Final System Integration" (7cfe41e)

### Critical Implementation Gaps Identified

#### 1. Mobile Application (Flutter) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Location**: `/mobile-app/lib/features/`

**Incomplete Features:**
- **Share Functionality** (`saved_articles_screen.dart:388`): Share button shows placeholder message
- **Language Selection** (`settings_screen.dart:150`): Settings show TODO comment
- **Data Export** (`settings_screen.dart:170`): Export functionality missing
- **Upload Retry Mechanism** (`edit_profile_screen.dart:263`): Background upload retry unimplemented
- **Voice Journal Search** (`voice_journal_screen.dart:53`): Search functionality missing
- **Voice Journal Settings** (`voice_journal_screen.dart:213-231`): Various settings TODO items
- **Habits Analytics Navigation** (`habits_screen.dart:395-423`): Multiple navigation TODOs

#### 2. Backend Services (Node.js/TypeScript) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Location**: `/services/api/src/`

**Status Assessment**:
- Coach Intelligence Service appears largely implemented (contrary to initial 52 TODO claim)
- Enhanced service implementation exists with comprehensive functionality
- OAuth 2.0 authentication system needs verification

#### 3. Frontend Applications (React/TypeScript) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Location**: `/apps/admin-panel/` and `/apps/cms-panel/`

**Incomplete Features:**
- **Dashboard Refresh** (`DashboardPage.tsx:336`): Data refresh mechanism TODO
- **CMS Calendar Components**: As identified in task recovery analysis
- **Analytics Integration**: New analytics architecture needs integration

#### 4. Cross-Platform Integration - LOW PRIORITY
**Status**: Type safety issues, testing frameworks, and deployment pipeline optimization
