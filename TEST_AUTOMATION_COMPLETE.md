- Produces markdown summaries for quick reviews

Usage:
```bash
node scripts/generate-test-report.js
```

Output:
- `test-report.html` - Interactive HTML dashboard
- `test-report.json` - Machine-readable results
- `test-summary.md` - Markdown summary

### 2. ✅ Test Coverage Badges and Reports

**Script:** `scripts/generate-badges.js`

Features:

- Coverage percentage badges (lines, branches, functions, statements)
- Test status badges (passing/failing)
- Performance metric badges
- Build status indicators

Usage:
```bash
node scripts/generate-badges.js
```

Output:
- `badges/` directory with all SVG files
- `badges/README.md` with badge showcase
- `badges/urls.json` for CI/CD integration

Badge Types:
- Coverage: `landing-lines-coverage.svg`, `backend-branches-coverage.svg`
- Status: `landing-tests-status.svg`, `backend-tests-count.svg`
- Performance: `hero-render-performance.svg`, `ai-response-performance.svg`
- Build: `build-status.svg`

### 3. ✅ Test Failure Notification System

**Script:** `scripts/test-notifier.js`

Features:
- Monitors test results for failures
- Detects performance regressions
- Identifies coverage drops
- Multiple notification channels:
  - Console output (color-coded)
  - File-based notifications
  - Webhook support
  - Slack integration ready

Configuration:
```bash
# Environment variables
NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS=console,file,webhook
TEST_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook.com
FAILURE_THRESHOLD=10
PERF_THRESHOLD=20
COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=5
```

Usage:
```bash
node scripts/test-notifier.js
```

Notification Types:
- Test failures with severity levels
- Performance regression alerts
- Coverage drop warnings
- Build status updates

### 4. ✅ Visual Regression Testing Setup

**Directory:** `visual-tests/`

Features:
- Playwright-based visual testing
- Multi-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Responsive design testing
- Component-level screenshots
- Cross-browser consistency checks
- Accessibility visual tests

Test Categories:
1. **Component Visual Tests**
   - Hero, Features, Pricing sections
   - Forms and modals
   - Navigation elements

2. **Responsive Design Tests**
   - 7 viewport sizes
   - Mobile menu states
   - Tablet layouts

3. **Interaction States**
   - Hover effects
   - Focus states
   - Loading indicators
   - Error states

4. **Cross-browser Tests**
   - Browser-specific rendering
   - CSS compatibility
   - Font rendering

5. **Accessibility Tests**
   - High contrast mode
   - Focus indicators
   - Color contrast

Usage:
```bash
cd visual-tests
npm install
npm run install:browsers

# Run tests
npm test

# Update baselines
npm run test:update

# View results
npm run test:report
```

GitHub Actions Integration:
- `.github/workflows/visual-tests.yml`
- Automatic PR comments on failures
- Artifact uploads for failed tests
- Baseline update workflow

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **Main Test Pipeline**
   ```yaml
   - Run unit tests
   - Run integration tests
   - Run scenario tests
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Create badges
   - Send notifications
   ```

2. **Visual Test Pipeline**
   ```yaml
   - Run visual tests on 3 browsers
   - Upload diff images
   - Comment on PRs
   - Update baselines (manual trigger)
   ```

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   ```yaml
   - Run performance tests
   - Analyze results
   - Check thresholds
   - Alert on regressions
   ```

## Automation Scripts Summary

| Script | Purpose | Frequency |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `analyze-performance.js` | Performance metrics analysis | On each test run |
| `generate-test-report.js` | HTML test dashboard | After test completion |
| `generate-badges.js` | SVG badge generation | On main branch |
| `test-notifier.js` | Failure notifications | On test failures |
