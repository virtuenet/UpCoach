## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
- API health checks at `/api/health`
- Service dependency monitoring
- Database connection monitoring
- Redis cache monitoring
- SSL certificate expiry monitoring

### Log Management
- Structured logging for all services
- Log rotation and retention (30 days)
- Error aggregation and alerting
- Performance metrics collection

### Backup Strategy
- Database backups every 6 hours
- Configuration backups before each deployment
- Retention: 30 days daily, 6 months weekly, 2 years monthly

### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempt tracking
- Rate limit violation alerts
- Unusual API usage pattern detection
- SSL certificate monitoring
- Security header compliance checks

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Stop current services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Restore from backup
pg_restore -d $DATABASE_URL backups/latest/database.sql

# Deploy previous version
git checkout previous-stable-tag
./deploy-production.sh
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# Restore database from backup
PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD pg_restore -h localhost -p 1433 -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME backup.sql
```

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Daily**: Monitor service health, check error logs
- **Weekly**: Review performance metrics, update dependencies
- **Monthly**: Security audit, backup verification, capacity planning
- **Quarterly**: Disaster recovery testing, security penetration testing
