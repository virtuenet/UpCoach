# Local LLM Implementation Monitoring & Checkpoint System

## Executive Summary

This document establishes a comprehensive monitoring and checkpoint system for UpCoach's 3-phase local LLM implementation. The system ensures quality gates, risk management, and continuous validation throughout the 20-week implementation period.

## Monitoring Framework Architecture

### 1. Real-Time Performance Monitoring

#### Server-Side Metrics
```typescript
// services/api/src/monitoring/LocalLLMMetrics.ts
interface LocalLLMMetrics {
  // Performance Metrics
  inferenceLatency: {
    p50: number;
    p95: number;
    p99: number;
  };
  
  // Quality Metrics
  responseQuality: {
    averageScore: number;
    userSatisfaction: number;
    fallbackRate: number;
  };
  
  // Resource Metrics
  resourceUtilization: {
    cpuUsage: number;
    memoryUsage: number;
    gpuUtilization: number;
  };
  
  // Business Metrics
  costOptimization: {
    localProcessingRate: number;
    costSavingsPercentage: number;
    totalCostReduction: number;
  };
}
```

#### Mobile Performance Metrics
```dart
// mobile-app/lib/core/monitoring/local_llm_metrics.dart
class LocalLLMMetrics {
  // Performance
  final Duration averageInferenceTime;
  final double batteryImpactPercentage;
  final int memoryUsageMB;
  
  // Quality
  final double responseQualityScore;
  final double offlineCapabilityRate;
  final int fallbackToCloudCount;
  
  // User Experience
  final double userSatisfactionScore;
  final int crashCount;
  final Duration averageResponseTime;
}
```

  private alerts: AlertRule[] = [];
  
  async collectMetrics(): Promise<void> {
    // Collect performance metrics
    const latencyMetrics = await this.measureInferenceLatency();
    const qualityMetrics = await this.assessResponseQuality();
    const resourceMetrics = await this.monitorResourceUsage();
    
    // Store metrics
    this.metrics.set('p95_latency', latencyMetrics.p95);
    this.metrics.set('response_quality', qualityMetrics.averageScore);
    this.metrics.set('local_processing_rate', await this.calculateLocalProcessingRate());
    
    // Check alert thresholds
    await this.checkAlerts();
    
    // Send to monitoring systems
    await this.sendToGrafana(this.metrics);
    await this.sendToDatadog(this.metrics);
  }
  
  private async checkAlerts(): Promise<void> {
    for (const alert of this.alerts) {
      const currentValue = this.metrics.get(alert.metric);
      if (currentValue && this.evaluateCondition(currentValue, alert.condition)) {
        await this.triggerAlert(alert);
