# ADR-002: Hybrid Routing Architecture Design

## Status
Accepted - 2024-01-15

## Context

The Local LLM implementation requires an intelligent routing system to decide when to process requests locally versus using cloud services. This decision is critical for balancing privacy, performance, cost, and user experience. The routing system must consider multiple factors and adapt dynamically to changing conditions.

### Decision Factors
- **Privacy Requirements**: User preferences and data sensitivity levels
- **Performance Constraints**: Device capabilities, battery levels, thermal states
- **Quality Expectations**: User tolerance for response quality variations
- **Cost Optimization**: Balancing infrastructure costs with API usage
- **Reliability**: Ensuring service availability through fallback mechanisms

### Technical Requirements
- Real-time decision making (<50ms overhead)
- Context-aware routing based on multiple signals
- Machine learning optimization over time
- Graceful fallback mechanisms
- Audit trail for compliance and debugging

## Decision

We will implement a **Multi-Factor Hybrid Decision Engine** with machine learning optimization and real-time adaptation capabilities.

### Core Architecture

```typescript
interface HybridDecisionEngine {
  routeRequest(request: RoutingRequest): Promise<RoutingDecision>;
  updateFromFeedback(decision: RoutingDecision, outcome: RequestOutcome): void;
  getOptimizationInsights(): RoutingInsights;
}
```

### Decision Algorithm

1. **Privacy Classification** (Weight: 40%)
   - Automatic content analysis for sensitive data
   - User-specified privacy levels
   - Regulatory compliance requirements

2. **Query Complexity Analysis** (Weight: 25%)
   - Token count and linguistic complexity
   - Required reasoning depth
   - Multi-step task identification

3. **Device Capability Assessment** (Weight: 20%)
   - Hardware specifications and model compatibility
   - Current resource availability (memory, GPU)
   - Battery level and thermal state

4. **Performance Requirements** (Weight: 10%)
   - User latency tolerance
   - Real-time vs. batch processing needs
   - Quality vs. speed preferences

5. **Cost Optimization** (Weight: 5%)
   - Current cloud API usage patterns
   - Local processing capacity utilization
   - Budget constraints and limits

### Routing Logic

```typescript
class HybridDecisionEngine {
  async routeRequest(request: RoutingRequest): Promise<RoutingDecision> {
    const factors = await this.analyzeRequest(request);
    const scores = this.calculateRoutingScores(factors);
    const decision = this.selectOptimalRoute(scores);
    
    // Apply business rules and constraints
    const finalDecision = this.applyBusinessRules(decision, factors);
    
    // Log for ML optimization
    this.logDecision(request, finalDecision, factors);
    
    return finalDecision;
  }

  private calculateRoutingScores(factors: RoutingFactors): RoutingScores {
    return {
      local: this.calculateLocalScore(factors),
      cloud: this.calculateCloudScore(factors),
      hybrid: this.calculateHybridScore(factors),
    };
  }

  private calculateLocalScore(factors: RoutingFactors): number {
    let score = 0.5; // Base score
    
    // Privacy boost
    score += factors.privacyScore * 0.4;
    
    // Device capability
    score += factors.deviceCapability * 0.2;
    
    // Battery consideration
    if (factors.batteryLevel < 20) score -= 0.3;
    else if (factors.batteryLevel > 80) score += 0.1;
    
    // Thermal state
    switch (factors.thermalState) {
      case 'critical': score -= 0.5; break;
      case 'serious': score -= 0.3; break;
      case 'fair': score -= 0.1; break;
    }
    
    // Complexity penalty for local
    score -= factors.complexityScore * 0.25;
    
    return Math.max(0, Math.min(1, score));
  }
}
```

### Alternative Routing Strategies Considered

#### Option 1: Simple Rule-Based Routing (Rejected)
- **Approach**: If-then rules based on privacy level only
- **Pros**: Simple to implement and debug
- **Cons**: Not adaptive, poor optimization, limited factors
- **Rejection Reason**: Insufficient for complex optimization requirements

#### Option 2: Machine Learning Only (Rejected)
- **Approach**: End-to-end ML model for all routing decisions
- **Pros**: Optimal learning and adaptation
- **Cons**: Black box decisions, compliance issues, training complexity
- **Rejection Reason**: Regulatory audit requirements need explainable decisions

#### Option 3: Round-Robin Load Balancing (Rejected)
- **Approach**: Alternate between local and cloud based on load
- **Pros**: Simple load distribution
- **Cons**: Ignores context, poor user experience, no privacy consideration
- **Rejection Reason**: Doesn't address privacy or quality requirements

#### Option 4: User Preference Only (Rejected)
- **Approach**: Let users choose local vs cloud for each request
- **Pros**: Maximum user control
- **Cons**: Poor UX, decision fatigue, suboptimal choices
- **Rejection Reason**: Places burden on users, reduces system intelligence
