# ADR-001: Local LLM Technology Choice and Architecture

## Status
Accepted - 2024-01-15

## Context

UpCoach needs to implement local Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities to address growing user demands for privacy-focused AI coaching, reduce dependency on cloud providers, and achieve cost optimization targets. The decision requires choosing appropriate models, inference engines, and integration patterns that balance performance, privacy, cost, and implementation complexity.

### Business Drivers
- **Privacy Concerns**: 73% of users express preference for local data processing
- **Cost Optimization**: Current AI processing costs of $6,000-$20,000/month for 10,000 users
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Market leadership in privacy-focused AI coaching
- **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and healthcare data protection requirements

### Technical Constraints
- **Mobile Performance**: Must run efficiently on iOS and Android devices
- **Resource Limitations**: Limited GPU memory and battery constraints
- **Integration Complexity**: Must integrate with existing AIService architecture
- **Quality Maintenance**: Response quality must remain â‰¥85% of cloud alternatives

## Decision

We will implement a **hybrid local/cloud LLM architecture** with the following technology choices:

### Primary Technology Stack

1. **Primary Model: Mistral 7B (Q4_K_M quantization)**
   - License: Apache 2.0 (commercial-friendly)
   - Size: ~3.5GB quantized
   - Performance: 15-30 tokens/second
   - Quality: Comparable to GPT-3.5 for coaching tasks

2. **Inference Engine: llama.cpp with Node.js bindings**
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Excellent quantization support
   - Active community and performance optimizations
   - TypeScript integration via node-llama-cpp

3. **Mobile Implementation**:
   - **iOS**: Core ML with Neural Engine optimization
   - **Android**: ONNX Runtime with NNAPI acceleration
   - **Models**: Phi-2 (3.8B) for flagship devices, TinyLlama (1.1B) for mid-range

4. **Hybrid Decision Engine**: Custom TypeScript implementation
   - Multi-factor routing (privacy, complexity, device capability)
   - Machine learning-based optimization
   - Real-time performance adaptation

### Alternative Options Considered

#### Option 1: Pure Cloud Architecture (Rejected)
- **Pros**: Simplicity, best performance, no device constraints
- **Cons**: Privacy concerns, cost escalation, vendor lock-in
- **Rejection Reason**: Doesn't address core business drivers

#### Option 2: Transformers.js (Rejected)
- **Pros**: JavaScript-native, browser compatibility
- **Cons**: Limited model support, poor performance, large bundle size
- **Rejection Reason**: Performance insufficient for production use

#### Option 3: TensorFlow Lite (Rejected)
- **Pros**: Google ecosystem, mobile optimization
- **Cons**: Limited LLM support, complex conversion pipeline
- **Rejection Reason**: Ecosystem maturity insufficient for LLMs

#### Option 4: ONNX Runtime Only (Partially Adopted)
- **Pros**: Cross-platform, good mobile support
- **Cons**: Limited quantization options, model conversion complexity
- **Decision**: Use for mobile Android, but llama.cpp for backend

## Consequences

   - Need for extensive quality monitoring
   - Fallback complexity for edge cases

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Quality Assurance**
   - Comprehensive A/B testing framework
   - Real-time quality monitoring
   - Graceful fallback to cloud processing

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Progressive model loading
   - Intelligent caching strategies
   - Battery and thermal awareness

3. **User Experience**
   - Transparent processing mode indicators
   - User preference controls
   - Smooth fallback experiences
