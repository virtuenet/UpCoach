## Deployment Sequence

### Phase 1: Backend Deployment (API Services)
**Estimated Duration:** 15 minutes
**Components:**
- Enhanced ForumService with input sanitization
- Enterprise policy management endpoints
- Financial notification webhooks
- Team limit validation services
- Email campaign automation
- Content analytics expansion

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Backend deployment
cd services/api
npm run build
npm run db:migrate:check
npm run deploy:production
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Deployment (Admin Panel)
**Estimated Duration:** 10 minutes
**Components:**
- Enhanced error monitoring in Layout.tsx
- Real-time dashboard with data refresh
- Improved admin user experience

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Frontend deployment
cd apps/admin-panel
npm run build
npm run deploy:production
```

### Phase 3: Verification & Health Checks
**Estimated Duration:** 15 minutes
**Verification Steps:**
1. API health check endpoints
2. Database connectivity verification
3. External service integrations (Stripe, Email)
4. Dashboard functionality validation
5. Error monitoring system verification

## Monitoring During Deployment

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Error Rates:** Should remain < 1%
2. **Response Times:** API responses < 500ms (95th percentile)
3. **Database Performance:** Query times within normal range
4. **Memory Usage:** No memory leaks or excessive usage
5. **User Experience:** No degradation in frontend performance

### Alert Triggers
- Error rate > 2% for 5 consecutive minutes
- API response time > 1000ms (95th percentile)
- Database connection pool > 90% utilization
- Memory usage > 85% of allocated

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 5% for 2 consecutive minutes
- Critical API endpoints returning 5xx errors
- Database connection failures
- External service integration failures

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# Immediate rollback command
./scripts/rollback-deployment.sh --environment=production --version=previous

# Rollback steps:
# 1. Switch traffic back to previous version
# 2. Revert database migrations (if any)
# 3. Restore previous configuration
# 4. Verify system stability
```
